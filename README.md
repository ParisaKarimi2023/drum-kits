# Drum Kits Web Application
The Drum Kits project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to play drum sounds using keyboard keys or mouse clicks. 
The project combines visual elements with audio feedback to simulate a real drum kit experience in a browser environment. It demonstrates the use of front-end web technologies to create engaging,
real-time user interactions and highlights concepts such as event handling, multimedia integration, and responsive UI design.
